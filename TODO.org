* From Alicia
** DONE Fix CCS dumbness 1: report is not a CSV file
** DONE Fix CCS dumbness 2: report should go alongside output dataset/BAM
  - Make it a web page instead of a giant PDF

   - Make a subreads dir that symlinks the subreads datasets (or absolutifies, actually)
     - change condition table to have: .remoteSubreads, .subreads ... maybe?

   - Make a basic subreads reports workflow
   - Make a basic mapping reports workflow

   - Output the CCS report correctly
   - Output the ccsdf csv


** DONE CCS: Make the calibration plots subsample
** DONE GC: Fix the residual plots
** TODO GC: Error out in validation if num P_ variables too high


* Laterish [0/6]

** TODO Move CT over to tertiary


** TODO Add a "config" capability to, for example, choose the consensus algo...

** TODO Get rid of the context stack, it doesn't really buy us anything
   Just pass extra arguments down, it's fine.

** TODO Make "run" work
** TODO Add --list-workflows
** TODO Make arguments snake case, it's POSIXy

** TODO Figure out where the extra newlines are coming from in the ninja output
** TODO Look into managing R dependencies using packrat so we're not at the mercy of what's on the cluster
** TODO Long-term: separate input table and secondary analysis options table

   Current picture:
   | Condition   |      RunCode | ReportsFolder | Genome                 | ConsensusAlgorithm |
   |-------------+--------------+---------------+------------------------+--------------------|
   | Ecoli_poa   | 3150122-0001 |               | ecoliK12_pbi_March2013 | poa                |
   | Ecoli_poa   | 3150122-0002 |               | ecoliK12_pbi_March2013 | poa                |
   | Ecoli_arrow | 3150122-0001 |               | ecoliK12_pbi_March2013 | arrow              |
   | Ecoli_arrow | 3150122-0002 |               | ecoliK12_pbi_March2013 | arrow              |


   Immediate problem: in the current system, redundant mappings will
   get run

   The broader problem is that secondary analysis options are getting
   conflated with the input specification.  So for example we have to
   needlessly duplicate the "ConsensusAlgorithm" column entries for all
   inputs in the condition.

   Cleaner, more powerful:

   Input table:
   | Condition   |      RunCode | ReportsFolder |
   |-------------+--------------+---------------|
   | Ecoli_poa   | 3150122-0001 |               |
   | Ecoli_poa   | 3150122-0002 |               |
   | Ecoli_arrow | 3150122-0001 |               |
   | Ecoli_arrow | 3150122-0002 |               |


   Secondary analysis table:
   | Condition   | Genome                 | ConsensusAlgorithm |
   |-------------+------------------------+--------------------|
   | Ecoli_poa   | ecoliK12_pbi_March2013 | poa                |
   | Ecoli_arrow | ecoliK12_pbi_March2013 | arrow              |

   Can imagine encoding much more than just this---secondary analysis version, etc.
** TODO We are implicitly assuming that we have distinct movie names within a condition.  We should validate this?
